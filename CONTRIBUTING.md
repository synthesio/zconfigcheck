## Making changes

Before you start working on an open issue, add a comment telling that you're going to tackle it.

If it's your first contribution, start by forking the repository.

Do not forget to:
- add new test cases whenever they are needed
- run unit tests before asking for review
- add an entry in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/synthesio/zconfigcheck/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file

Commit messages should follow these [guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
